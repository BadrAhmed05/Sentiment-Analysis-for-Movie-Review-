# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Movie-Review-
Design a model to apply Sentiment Analysis of movie reviews using sentiment polarity datasets (Use a machine learning model to classify the movies reviews into positive and negative, train and test model and generate accuracy). The overall process of model training and testing should be recorded and displayed using a proper chart.



Dataset: 
The data set is txt_sentoken which is divided into 2 folders 
positive reviews and negative reviews.  
Preprocessing: 
1- Splitting data into (80% train and 20% test). 
2- Encoding for classes.  
3- Converting all documents to lower case.  
4- Removing punctuation and stop words. 
5- Word tokenization  
6- Get the stem and lemma for each word in document. 
Feature Extraction: 
We apply TF-IDF: statistical measure used in the fields of 
information retrieval (IR) and machine learning, that can 
quantify the importance or relevance of string 
representations (words, phrases, lemmas, etc.) in a 
document amongst a collection of documents. 
Models: 
We implemented machine and deep learning models to 
make classification. 
Machine Learning models: 
1- SVM  
2- Na√Øve bayes  
3- Logistic regression 
4- Random forest  
5- K-NN 
6- Gradient boosting  

-  This is the confusion matrix of SVM:
